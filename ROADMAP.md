# Roadmap

These are the things I would add or change about this app:

- There is currently no way to remove items from the cart, first would be a trash icon or similar on each line item.
- Display something to indicate loading state while the user waits for the request to finish
- Tests. There are currently none
- Indication of error. Right now I am loading mock data when the API call fails, but if we were relying only on the server response it would be important to indicate a failed request.
- Expandable/collapsible sections for each menu item, especially if there may be future menu items with many options or modifiers (spice level, add-ons, etc.)
- In that same vein, it would be nice to automatically select a default option if the food item only has 1 (such as the burger). This would save a click.
- There are plenty of visual improvements that should be made as well, like text alignment, spacing, etc
